This particle affinity simulation models emergent behavior in multi-agent systems. Each particle type has preferences (affinities) for being near certain other types while avoiding others.

Key Features:

Rust + WASM: High-performance simulation logic compiled to WebAssembly
WebGPU Rendering: Hardware-accelerated graphics for smooth visualization
Scalability: Handles large grids (1000Ã—1000+) efficiently
Real-time: 60 FPS simulation and rendering

Particle Behavior:

Particles move to positions that maximize their happiness (affinity score)
Particles can convert nearby particles to preferred types
The interaction radius determines how far particles can sense others
Higher density creates more complex emergent patterns

Color Coding:

Black represents empty space
Each particle type has a unique color (red, green, blue, yellow, etc.)
Particles of the same type will often cluster together

Inspiration:
The 'particle affinity' algorithm was described in the following video, although there was no code implementation provided.
